    "Abalone are a class of marine snails that create a shell of \"nacre\" of increasing thickness over the course of their lifetime. A very good indication of the age of a particular abalone is the number of \"rings\" of nacre that have been deposited in the creation of the shell. We are going to look at a data set that is used to estimate the number of rings of a particular abalone shell based on various other abalone characteristics.\n",
